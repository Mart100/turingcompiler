- When optimizing the TAC, put variables in the order of most used to least used.
Because the first variables takes the least amount of time to access.
- Reuse temporary variables that are no longer needed.

- Add syntax errors.

- make multiple statements inside if/else body possible
- Add While loops

- BENCHMARKS, see how many steps it takes to run snippets
And try to improve the optimization

- Add ++, --. -=. +=, *=

- Add &&, ||, !, !=

- Show original variable names in debugger

- print and input functions.
